An attacker can supply crafted input to break out of the data context in which their input appears and interfere with the structure of the surrounding query.\n\n','Various attacks can be delivered via SQL injection, including reading or modifying critical application data, interfering with application logic, escalating privileges within the database and executing operating system commands.\n\n',NULL,'We recommend that a code review be performed to ensure all SQLi vulnerabilities are resolved.\n\nThe most effective way to prevent SQL injection attacks is to use parameterised queries (also known as prepared statements) for all database access. \n\nThis method uses two steps to incorporate potentially tainted data into SQL queries: First, the application specifies the structure of the query, leaving placeholders for each item of user input; Second, the application specifies the contents of each placeholder. Because the structure of the query has already defined in the first step, it is not possible for malformed data in the second step to interfere with the query structure. You should review the documentation for your database and application platform to determine the appropriate APIÕs, which you can use to perform parameterised queries. \n\nIt is strongly recommended that you parameterise every variable data item that is incorporated into database queries, even if it is not obviously tainted, to prevent oversights occurring and avoid vulnerabilities being introduced by changes elsewhere within the code base of the application.\n\nYou should be aware that some commonly employed and recommended mitigations for SQL injection vulnerabilities are not always effective:\n\nOne common defence is to double up any single quotation marks appearing within user input before incorporating that input into a SQL query. This defence is designed to prevent malformed data from terminating the string in which it is inserted. However, if the data being incorporated into queries is numeric, then the defence may fail, because numeric data may not be encapsulated within quotes, in which case only a space is required to break out of the data context and interfere with the query. \n\nFurther, in second-order SQL injection attacks, data that has been safely escaped when initially inserted into the database is subsequently read from the database and then passed back to it again. Quotation marks that have been doubled up initially will return to their original form when the data is reused, allowing the defence to be bypassed.\n\nAnother often cited defence is to use stored procedures for database access. While stored procedures can provide security benefits, they are not guaranteed to prevent SQL injection attacks. The same kinds of vulnerabilities that arise within standard dynamic SQL queries can arise if any SQL is dynamically constructed within stored procedures. Further, even if the procedure is sound, SQL injection can arise if the procedure is invoked in an unsafe manner using user-controllable data.\n\nEnsure all parameters are canonicalised and input validated in the correct locale. \n\nIf dynamic queries are to be used, all data must be appropriately output encoded for the type of SQL server in use. This is still highly dangerous and even one improperly encoded or missing parameter can lead to SQL injection, so HackLabs strongly recommends that dynamic queries are removed completely from the application and prohibited within the organisation. \n\nPrepared Statements should be used to send precompiled SQL Statements to the backend database, along with the various validated parameters supplied by the user. The database will not interpret the value of the parameters within Prepared Statements, leaving the application immune to SQL Injection vulnerabilities.\n\nThe application should use the lowest possible privilege level when accessing the database, removing default database functions that are not needed and applying all relevant database patches.\n\nConsider performing a Secure Code Review, which will find all potential issues within an application. This is particularly useful for high value transactional systems, or applications that have proven difficult to remediate over time. \n\n\n','2015-07-16 12:34:53','2015-07-16 12:34:53',12),(165,'IDS Monitoring & Alerting \n','The Intrusions Detection System (IDS) did not detect the attacks that were generated during testing.\n\n','Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are used to detect attacks on the critical systems.

For an Ethernet network to function properly, only one active path can exist between two stations. \nMultiple active paths between stations cause loops in the network. If a loop exists in the network topology, the potential exists for duplication of messages. When loops occur, some switches see stations appear on both sides of the switch. This condition confuses the forwarding algorithm and allows duplicate frames to be forwarded. \nIf not configured properly an attacker may have the ability to become the root path and capture all traffic on the segment.

This allows an attacker to gather information such as usernames, groups and servers, as well as the ability to dump a large portion of the NDS tree, including detailed object information. This may lead to the attacker being able to authenticate to a server, gaining access to a large amount of sensitive information, possibly gaining full control over the Novell servers.\n\n',NULL,'HackLabs recommend a number of recommendations for this vulnerability:\n* Minimise NDS tree browsing by adding an inheritance rights filter (IRF) to the root of the tree. Tree information is incredibly sensitive and should not be able to be browsed by anyone.\n* To prevent the enumeration of objects via the NetWare 5.x leak, remove Browse rights from the NDS object [Public] and restrict tree access to authenticated users. This may require login scripts to be updated to refer to servers by IP address or setup DNS entries for all server names.\nEnsure that a strong password policy is enforced throughout the organisation to ensure that passwords are not easily crackable. These passwords should be at least 7 characters, containing upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Also ensure that the Intruder Detection and Lockout feature has been enabled and configured for all users.* \n* Enforce restrictive rights on all volumes, directories, and files, as well as on all NDS objects, including Organisations, Organisational Units, servers, users, and so on.\nBy default, Netware has a large number of services running, including nine web-based services listening on ports 80, 81, 443, 2200, 2211, 8008, 8009, and 51443. All unnecessary services should be shutdown, or contained by tight ACLs, and all system and software versions should be kept up-to-date. This will ensure that the number of vulnerabilities associated with open services and software versions are minimised.* \n* Ensure that the Admin (or equivalent) user does not reside in the same container as generic users. These usersÕ passwords should be 17 characters or longer, since the most popular Netware cracking software can only crack passwords up to 16 characters long.\n* NCP Packet Signatures should be used to encrypt packets as they traverse the network and are a great addition to your internal security if your server can keep up with the extra workload of encrypting and decrypting all packets.\n\n\n','2015-07-16 12:34:53','2015-07-16 12:34:53',10),(301,'Personal Information Disclosure \n','This host contain numerous files, which are related to individual users business and not corporate activities.\n\n','Personal information being freely available on a servers hard drive rather that in a personal section of a secured file server opens up the user in question to various social engineering attacks. \n\n',NULL,'Using critical servers as workstations us not a recommended practice.
